## about

- `mj-pa` is my personal [Prettier](https://prettier.io) config tailored to format JS, JSON, & JSX.
- Opinionated by nature, it seeks to improve code simplicity and readability.
- For best results, `mj-pa` should be used in a React- or Vue-based environment.

Here is a look at the configuration object it exports.

## usage

> IMPORTANT: You must have [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) installed in your project for [mj-pa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mj-pa) to work properly.

### 1) install

Using npm

```shell
npm install --save-dev mj-pa
```

Using yarn

```shell
yarn add -D mj-pa
```

### 2) configure

Edit the `package.json` file for your project to extend Prettier with `mj-pa`. Or, to be more specific, copy the following line of code and paste it underneath the `version` line of your project's `package.json` file in the root directory.

```json
{
 "prettier": "mj-pa"
}
```

### 3) format

Nothing changes here; run the `check` or `write` command as you normally would

```shell
npx prettier --check .
```

```shell
npx prettier --write .
```

## output

 > ðŸ‘‰ FUN FACT: `mj-pa` is short for "Make JavaScript Pretty Again"â€” because what JS developer doesn't love a good one-liner? ðŸ˜Ž

Here is an example of how your VSCode logs will appear when `mj-pa` is used to extend the default configuration so formatting can be applied in turn by the [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for Prettier.
